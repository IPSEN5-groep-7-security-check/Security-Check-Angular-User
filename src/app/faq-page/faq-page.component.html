        <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default,

        element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
        hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding
        our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within
        the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
